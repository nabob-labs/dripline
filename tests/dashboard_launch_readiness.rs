//! The dashboard launch contract: what has to hold for a launched window to stop
//! showing its loading state.
//!
//! The regression this file exists for: the app opened, navigated to the
//! dashboard, and stayed in its skeleton forever. Nothing was wrong with the
//! dashboard. `tokens_new` failed to initialize while migrating the token
//! database onto the chain-scoped schema, the process exited, and the only
//! thing gating the loader — `GET /api/system/bootstrap` reporting `ui_ready` —
//! could therefore never flip.
//!
//! So the launch graph covered here is exactly the one a stuck window implicates:
//!
//! * the token database opens (a pre-chain-identity file included) — failing it
//!   kills the process that serves everything below;
//! * `/api/system/bootstrap` answers a parseable, stable contract in every
//!   readiness state, quickly, and without a service manager;
//! * that contract carries a terminal decision — `ui_ready` flips exactly when
//!   the frontend prerequisites are up, and `retry_after_ms` is present only
//!   while the loader still has to poll;
//! * an uninitialized wallet database is reported as absent, never as a failure;
//! * the webserver stays usable while core services are still starting.
//!
//! These are pure/local: no network, no wallet, isolated temp storage.
