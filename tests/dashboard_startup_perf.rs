//! Dashboard first-paint cost, measured against the OWNER'S REAL DATABASE.
//!
//! The launch symptom this tier exists to catch: the app window opens, the loading screen
//! clears, and then every panel — header, home hero, featured row — sits in its skeleton
//! for tens of seconds while the tabs refuse to switch. That is not a rendering problem,
//! it is the API handlers behind those panels blocking on the first filtering snapshot,
//! and every token-database read in the process queuing behind the one connection mutex
//! that snapshot holds.
//!
//! So the measurements here are deliberately the ones a user actually waits on:
//!
//! * [`candidate_load_is_index_driven`] — the batch load a snapshot opens with. It must be
//!   driven by the market-data timestamp indexes, not a full scan of every token row.
//! * [`first_snapshot_fits_refresh_interval`] — the whole `compute_snapshot`, which the
//!   refresh loop repeats every 30s. Overrunning that means the bot is permanently
//!   rebuilding.
//! * [`header_stats_do_not_block_on_first_snapshot`] — the header endpoint's stats read,
//!   taken with NO snapshot built. This is the one that produced the 30-second hang.
//! * [`token_count_is_cheap_under_snapshot_load`] — a count served while a snapshot build
//!   holds the token database, i.e. exactly the contention the launch sequence creates.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Filtering WRITES (rejection status, priorities, stats), so this never touches the live
//! files: [`common::real_db_env`] clones the databases into a temp directory and repoints
//! `VELOXBOT_DATA_DIR` at the clone. The bot may be running throughout.
//!
//! # Tier
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, real-data. They self-skip when no real database exists. Run with:
//! `cargo nextest run -E 'binary(dashboard_startup_perf)' --run-ignored all --success-output immediate`
