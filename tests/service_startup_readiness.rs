//! Boots the real service layer offline and proves it still comes up.
//!
//! Sixteen recent commits reorganized service registration, process-global
//! `OnceLock` initialization, database opening, signing and swap-router
//! registration. Nothing booted the whole service layer in a test before this
//! file, so a startup hang or an accessor read before its writer only showed up
//! when the owner ran the app.
//!
//! # Process-global state
//!
//! This binary constructs a real `ServiceManager`, registers the full service
//! list by calling `crate::run::services::register_all_services` itself — the
//! same function production boots through, so a service added there is covered
//! here automatically — which also calls `set_router_factory` /
//! `set_runtime_factory` —
//! both one-shot `OnceLock`-backed globals. Every test in this file therefore
//! shares process-global state (the swap router registry, the wallet-watch
//! runtime factory, the readiness flags in `veloxbot::global`) with every
//! OTHER test in this file and must not assume isolation from them. In
//! practice there is exactly one boot test below for that reason.
//!
//! No network, no RPC endpoint, no wallet key, no running bot: `isolated_env`
//! points every path at a fresh temp directory and config stays at defaults.
//! The only persisted fixture is an account refresh token, proving the account
//! service restores it before the dashboard can report a signed-out state.
