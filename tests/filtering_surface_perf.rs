//! Cost of OPENING the filtering tab, measured against the OWNER'S REAL DATABASE.
//!
//! `dashboard_startup_perf` covers the launch stall — the snapshot build and the endpoints
//! that used to wait on it. This tier covers what is left once nothing waits: the reads the
//! filtering tab itself issues the moment it is opened. Its three sub-tabs all read
//! `update_tracking` through the rejection columns, and every one of those reads is
//! a full scan plus a temp b-tree sort of the whole table unless the partial rejection
//! indexes exist:
//!
//! * [`status_tab_rejection_stats_are_index_driven`] — the GROUP BY behind the Status tab's
//!   rejection breakdown, which the page also re-polls every 5 seconds.
//! * [`analytics_tab_reads_are_index_driven`] — the three database reads the Analytics
//!   endpoint makes on one request, including the "most recently rejected" list whose
//!   `ORDER BY last_rejection_at DESC` sorted 430k rows to return 20.
//! * [`explore_tab_pages_are_index_driven`] — Explore always pages WITHIN one rejection
//!   reason, and its "last page" control issues a binary search of these same requests, so
//!   a slow page is paid five to seven times over.
//! * [`opening_the_filtering_tab_never_waits_for_a_snapshot`] — every read the tab issues on
//!   activation, run concurrently with NO snapshot built. This is the front delay itself:
//!   the wall-clock time between the click and the tab having its numbers.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! [`common::real_db_env`] clones the databases into a temp directory and repoints
//! `VELOXBOT_DATA_DIR`, so the live files are never touched and the bot may be running.
//! The clone pays a one-time index build on first open (~3 s against the owner's database),
//! which is startup cost, not query cost — every measurement below takes a warm pass first.
//!
//! # Tier
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, real-data, one test per process. They self-skip when no real database
//! exists. Run with:
//! `cargo nextest run -E 'binary(filtering_surface_perf)' --run-ignored all -j1 --success-output immediate`
