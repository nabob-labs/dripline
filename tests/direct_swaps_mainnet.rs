//! Direct pool swaps against real mainnet state.
//!
//! Two tiers live here, and they are deliberately different in what they risk:
//!
//! * **live** (`#[ignore]`, `./test.sh live`) — loads a real pool, quotes it,
//!   builds the real transaction and SIMULATES it. The node executes the exact
//!   account list, instruction data and `min_out` a real swap would carry,
//!   against real balances, and nothing is signed or submitted. A wrong account
//!   order, a bad discriminator, an under-sized compute budget or an
//!   unsatisfiable `min_out` all fail here, for free. This is the tier that must
//!   be green before any real swap is attempted.
//! * **mainnet** (`#[ignore]` + [`common::require_mainnet`], `./test.sh mainnet`)
//!   — submits a real swap and a real sell-back, capped at `SB_TEST_MAX_LAMPORTS`.
//!   Self-skips unless `SB_TEST_MAINNET_SWAP=1` and `SB_TEST_WALLET` are both set,
//!   so the live command above never spends anything.
//!
//! The pools are hardcoded because a live test needs a real one. They are the
//! deepest pool of each venue, chosen so they stay alive; if one is ever drained
//! or migrated, the fix is to repoint the constant, not to weaken the assertion.

// ============================================================================
// THE SELL LEG — proved on chain, for free, against a real holder
// ============================================================================
//
// Every zero-slippage exactness test above is a BUY: WSOL in, token out. The
// sell leg was only ever proved by actually spending, which is why two venues
// (DAMM v2, pump-swap) have never had a sell executed at all and the rest were
// proved one real round trip at a time.
//
// A simulation runs with `sigVerify: false`, so the owner never signs and
// nothing is spent — which means ANY mainnet address can stand in as the owner,
// including one that already holds the token. Picking a real holder whose
// ASSOCIATED token account carries the balance turns the sell leg into exactly
// the same free, exact proof the buy leg already has: the pool programme
// enforces `min_out`, so a node accepting `min_out == expected_out` proves the
// sell direction does not over-state its output by one raw unit, and it proves
// the sell's account list, orientation and fee side at the same time.

/// Real mainnet wallets whose ASSOCIATED token account for `mint` currently
/// holds something, richest first, with what each holds.
///
/// The candidates come from the POOL'S OWN RECENT TRADES rather than from
/// `getTokenLargestAccounts` — two reasons, both discovered the hard way. Public
/// RPC endpoints refuse `getTokenLargestAccounts` outright (it is one of the
/// expensive scans they disable), and even where it answers, the twenty largest
/// accounts of a real token are protocol vaults and PDAs, not the ordinary
/// wallets this engine is built to spend from. Whoever traded the pool an hour
/// ago is exactly the right population: a wallet, holding the token, in its
/// associated account.
