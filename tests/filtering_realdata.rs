//! Filtering against the OWNER'S REAL DATABASE — hundreds of thousands of live tokens,
//! not fixtures.
//!
//! Synthetic tokens can only prove that a rule does what it says. Only the real corpus
//! answers the questions that matter: what fraction of tokens survive the shipped
//! configuration, which rule is actually doing the rejecting, and whether a full snapshot
//! fits inside its 30-second refresh interval.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Filtering WRITES (rejection status, priorities, rejection stats), so these tests never
//! touch the live files. [`common::real_db_env`] clones the databases into a temp
//! directory and repoints `DRIPLINE_DATA_DIR` at the clone; every write lands there
//! and the clone is deleted when the test ends. The bot may be running throughout.
//!
//! # Tier
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, run by `./test.sh live`. They self-skip when no real database exists.
//! By default they sample [`DEFAULT_SAMPLE`] tokens so a debug build finishes in
//! reasonable time; set `SB_TEST_REALDB_FULL=1` for the entire corpus.
