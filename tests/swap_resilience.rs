//! Swap and action resilience — the guards that keep a trade from getting STUCK.
//!
//! Every test here exists because of a real stuck sell: a manual "sell all" that
//! reached `Executing swap via Jupiter` and then produced no further log line, no
//! error and no completion for as long as the app stayed up. The position sat in
//! "Selling", its slot permit stayed consumed, and the exit action never resolved.
//!
//! These are pure/local tests — no chain, no provider, no network egress. The HTTP
//! ones bind a loopback listener so the "server that never answers" case is exact
//! and deterministic rather than something we hope to observe against a real host.
