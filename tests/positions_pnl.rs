//! Pure: position profit & loss — the single most consequential arithmetic in the bot.
//!
//! Every downstream decision reads this number. The emergency risk limit force-sells at
//! 90% down; the loss limiter pauses entries off realized P&L; the dashboard, the
//! Telegram notifications and the trading stats all render it. A P&L that is wrong in
//! the pessimistic direction liquidates healthy positions, and one wrong in the
//! optimistic direction hides losses until the wallet is empty.
//!
//! Four historical bugs are pinned down here, each of which produced a plausible-looking
//! but wrong number:
//!   * partial-exit proceeds omitted, so a position that sold half at 2x read as a loss;
//!   * cost basis taken from the FIRST buy, so a DCA'd position looked profitable as
//!     soon as it recovered that first buy;
//!   * `exit_price` treated as "closed", so a position whose close FAILED had its P&L
//!     computed as if it held nothing;
//!   * proceeds overwritten instead of accumulated on the final close.
//!
//! Decimals are pre-seeded into the token cache so the token-amount branches run with
//! no DB and no RPC.
