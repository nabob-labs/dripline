// exactly one permit for its lifetime, and several terminal paths can run for the same
// position — archiving or force-closing frees the slot immediately, and the exit
// verification already queued frees it again when it lands. Each extra release hands
// the trader a slot it does not own, so the bot quietly opens MORE positions than the
// user configured, and nothing repairs it until the next startup reconcile.

/// One test, not several: the semaphore is a process-global `OnceLock`, so a second
/// test's `init_global_position_semaphore` would be a no-op and inherit whatever the
/// first left behind. Keeping the whole invariant in a single test makes it correct
/// under a shared-process runner too, not only under nextest's process-per-test.
