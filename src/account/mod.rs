//! The optional VeloxBot account, as seen from inside the app.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHAT SIGNING IN DOES AND DOES NOT DO
//! ============================================================================
//! It ADDS three things: free broadcasting of transactions you have already
//! signed, token voting that counts once per person, and your referral totals
//! in the app. It GATES nothing. Every feature that worked before an account
//! existed works identically with no account, and that is a rule rather than a
//! current state of affairs — see `is_signed_in()` callers, none of which may
//! guard a trading path.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHAT LEAVES THIS MACHINE
//! ============================================================================
//! Only what a sign-in requires: on the browser path, nothing at all (the
//! browser talks to the server, not us); on the password path, the email and
//! password for the duration of one request; on the wallet path, a public
//! address and a signature over a message the user can read. Never a private
//! key, never a position, never a balance, never a trade.
//!
//! Three ways in, one result. See `client.rs` for the wire calls, `pkce.rs` for
//! why a public binary can do this safely, and `store.rs` for where the refresh
//! token rests.
