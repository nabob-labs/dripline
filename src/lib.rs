//! DripLine — Core library for automated Solana DeFi trading.
//!
//! Provides token discovery, on-chain analysis, position management,
//! swap execution, and a web dashboard for monitoring and control.

// `dead_code` stays allowed: this is pre-release code with subsystems wired ahead of
// their callers, and auditing ~45 never-used items is a separate deliberate pass.
// Every other lint is ON — a blanket `allow(warnings)` previously hid 463 warnings,
// including API failure stats that were never recorded because an async call sat in a
// synchronous closure and was never awaited.
