//! Types for version management and the two-component update system.
//!
//! A release ships two independently replaceable components that share one
//! version number:
//!
//! * **core** — the `dripline` binary (it also embeds the whole dashboard).
//!   It can be replaced silently: the file is staged under the data directory
//!   and the desktop shell picks it up the next time it launches the backend.
//! * **shell** — the Electron bundle (Chromium + the main process). Replacing it
//!   needs the operating-system installer, so it is only downloaded when the
//!   shell actually changed, identified by `shell_revision`.
