//! Referral attribution — an OPT-IN way to credit whoever introduced you.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! THIS IS THE ONLY PART OF DRIPLINE THAT REPORTS ANYTHING ABOUT YOU, AND IT
//! IS OFF UNTIL YOU TYPE A CODE.
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! With `code` empty — the default — nothing is ever sent anywhere. No ping, no
//! heartbeat, no wallet address, no telemetry of any kind. The activation
//! request is not made at all.
//!
//! With a code set, ONE request goes to dripline.io carrying exactly:
//!
//!     { referral_code, signed_wallet_proofs[], platform, version }
//!
//! Each proof contains a PUBLIC address and a signature over a short statement
//! binding that address to the chosen code and current time. The private key
//! never leaves this machine, and the signed text cannot be used as a Solana
//! transaction. The website needs the proof because a public address alone does
//! not show who chose the code.
//!
//! This repository is public. That claim is checkable by reading
//! `src/services/implementations/referral_service.rs`, which is the only code
//! that sends anything, and it is why the guarantee is worth stating.
