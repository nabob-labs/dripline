//! WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* IN THIS FILE
//! ============================================================================
//! **The server address.** It is a compile-time constant in
//! `src/account/client.rs` and can never be a config field. `config.toml` is
//! plain text that people paste into bug reports and screenshots, and a
//! config-editable auth endpoint is a credential-phishing primitive: change one
//! line and the next sign-in posts an email and password to somebody else's
//! server. `referral.endpoint` IS editable because it carries nothing but
//! public wallet addresses; nothing here may follow that pattern.
//!
//! **Tokens.** Access and refresh tokens live in the encrypted store
//! (`src/account/store.rs`), never in the config file.
//!
//! An account is entirely OPTIONAL. Every switch here defaults to the
//! conservative answer, and with no account signed in the bot behaves exactly
//! as it always has.
