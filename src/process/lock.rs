//! Process Lock Module
//!
//! Prevents multiple instances of DripLine from running simultaneously using file-based locking.
//!
//! **Implementation:**
//! - Uses fslock for advisory file locking (cross-platform)
//! - Lock file: `data/.dripline.lock`
//! - RAII pattern: Lock held for entire bot lifetime, automatically released on drop
//! - OS automatically releases lock if process crashes (no stale locks)
//!
//! **Usage:**
//! ```rust
//! let _lock = ProcessLock::acquire()?;
//! // Lock held until _lock is dropped (end of scope)
//! ```
