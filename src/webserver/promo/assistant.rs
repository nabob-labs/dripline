//! Promo generators for the Assistant page's tabs other than Overview
//! (`llm_analysis.rs` owns `/api/llm-analysis/status`).
//!
//! Every one of these tabs reads a local database that a fresh install has never
//! written: Providers lists the operator's own configured keys, Instructions and
//! Automation are user-authored records, History and Chat are the operator's own
//! conversations. Captured live they either publish private working material or —
//! more often — photograph an empty state, which is what a screenshot must never
//! show of a feature that works.
//!
//! The tabs describe one coherent desk: the same five providers `llm_analysis.rs` reports as
//! configured, six instruction rules, three scheduled tasks whose run history and
//! aggregate statistics reconcile with each other, and a decision log whose newest
//! entries are the ones the Overview tab shows as recent decisions.
