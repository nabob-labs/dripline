//! Dashboard routes for the optional VeloxBot account.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHERE THESE ROUTES LIVE, AND WHY IT MATTERS
//! ============================================================================
//! Everything here is under `/api/account`, which is INSIDE the GUI security
//! token gate (`webserver/middleware.rs`). That placement is load-bearing.
//! The setup screen is exactly where the sign-in panel lives, which makes
//! hanging these endpoints off the initialization namespace an obvious
//! shortcut, but every API that changes state remains inside the token gate.
//!
//! It would also publish the sign-in API to every website the user has open: a
//! page in another tab can POST to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` all day, and the
//! token header is the only thing that stops it. `initialization_gate` is
//! extended for `/api/account` instead, so these routes work before setup
//! completes while still requiring the token.
//!
//! The ONE exception is the OAuth callback, which is registered on the root
//! router rather than here — see `handlers::oauth_callback` for why it can be
//! exempt safely.
