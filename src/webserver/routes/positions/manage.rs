//! Position management routes — archive, unarchive, delete, and bulk-clear.
//!
//! Archive is a reversible flag (position hidden from open/closed lists, surfaced
//! in the Archived tab). Delete is a permanent hard-delete that cascades ONLY to
//! the position's own child rows (states, exits, entries, tracking, snapshots).
//! Transactions, tokens, wallets, and events are never touched here.
//!
//! Removing a position that is still OPEN frees its trading slot (semaphore
//! permit) so the bot can open a new position; it does NOT sell — tokens stay in
//! the wallet.
