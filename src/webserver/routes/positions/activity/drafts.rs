//! Collecting a token's activity from every source that holds a piece of it.
//!
//! Four sources, and each knows something the others do not:
//!
//!   1. the entry/exit RECORDS of every position ever opened on the mint — authoritative
//!      for what the position actually booked (amount, price, SOL, exit percentage);
//!   2. the positions' own `entry_transaction_signature` / `exit_transaction_signature` —
//!      the only trace of a swap that is submitted but not yet verified (no record yet);
//!   3. the PENDING REGISTRIES — a DCA add or a partial exit in flight is not stamped on
//!      the position at all, so until verification its signature lives nowhere else;
//!   4. the wallet's TRANSACTIONS — every tx that ever touched the mint, which is how
//!      transfers, airdrops and swaps made outside the bot get into the timeline.
