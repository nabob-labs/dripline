//! Token boosts — the paid promotion standing published by veloxbot.io.
//!
//! A boost is bought on the website (`veloxbot.io/boost`): a confirmed payment
//! promotes a mint for a fixed window, and enough active boosts unlock the Golden
//! tier. The website owns the money, the ledger and the thresholds; the desktop app
//! only READS the resulting standing.
//!
//! This module is the single source of that truth in the app. Everything that
//! surfaces a boost reads [`cache::active_boosts`]:
//!
//! - `GET /api/boosts` — the flat feed the dashboard polls to gold-mark table rows
//! - `routes::featured` — the boosted band at the top of the featured row and the
//!   Boosted category of the featured dialog
//!
//! Nothing else may fetch the website feed: two callers would mean two orders and
//! two definitions of "boosted", which is exactly how the same token ends up gold
//! in one surface and plain in another.
