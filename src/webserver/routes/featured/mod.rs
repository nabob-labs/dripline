//! Featured token routes
//!
//! The discovery surfaces of the dashboard — the featured row above the status bar
//! and the full featured dialog — read from here. Two kinds of source feed them:
//!
//! - **Boosted** — tokens their owners PAID to promote on dripline.io. The
//!   standing comes from `routes::boosts`; these cards carry `boosts`/`golden` and
//!   every surface pins them above the organic rows.
//! - **Discovery** — Jupiter top-organic/top-traded and DexScreener trending. Third
//!   party rankings, never gold, never `boosts > 0`.
//!
//! Every category is normalized into one `FeaturedCard` and enriched from our LOCAL
//! database — never a live provider call for stats.
