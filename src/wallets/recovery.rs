//! Wallet-data recovery — safe backup-then-clean of the wallet-scoped databases.
//!
//! When the configured wallet no longer matches the wallet recorded in local
//! history (see [`crate::wallets::validation`]), the previous wallet's local
//! trade/position/history data must be cleared before the new wallet can start.
//! This module performs that reset **safely**: every affected database (and its
//! SQLite `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars) is copied into a timestamped backup directory
//! before the originals are removed, so nothing is ever lost irrecoverably.
//!
//! No on-chain funds are touched — only this computer's local databases.
