//! The ONE way this app talks to the VeloxBot data service.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
//! ============================================================================
//! Six subsystems read from veloxbot.io/data — candles, the SOL/USD reference
//! chart, the pool registry, Rugcheck reports, token decimals and boosted-token
//! identity. Each of them used to build its own URL, own timeout, own "was that
//! a 200?" check and own silent `None`. That was survivable while the service was
//! open; it stopped being survivable the moment the service started asking WHO
//! is calling, because six copies of an authentication rule is six chances to
//! get it wrong and no place at all to answer "why is my data missing?".
//!
//! So: one client. It resolves the endpoint, attaches the credential, states
//! this build's version, classifies the answer, and publishes a single
//! availability state that the setup screen and Settings both read.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! IT IS AN ACCELERATOR, NEVER A DEPENDENCY
//! ============================================================================
//! Every caller falls back to its direct provider on `None`, and that is a rule
//! rather than a coincidence. A signed-out install discovers tokens, prices
//! pools, charts candles and trades exactly as before — slower, against public
//! rate limits, with thinner history. Nothing here may become load-bearing for a
//! trade.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHY A SIGNED-OUT INSTALL MAKES NO REQUEST AT ALL
//! ============================================================================
//! We know the answer before we ask: without an account there is no credential
//! to present, and the service will refuse. Sending the request anyway would
//! spend a round trip per token per refresh to be told something we already
//! knew, and would put a wall of 401s in the service's logs that says nothing.
