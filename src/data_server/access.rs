//! Whether DripLine data is available to this install, and what to say if not.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHY THE SENTENCE LIVES IN RUST
//! ============================================================================
//! Three surfaces explain this to the same person: the first-run introduction,
//! the setup screen's account panel, and Settings. If each composed its own
//! wording they would drift, and the one that drifted would be the one the user
//! read first. So the state carries its own headline and detail, every surface
//! renders what it is given, and improving the sentence is a one-line change.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHY THIS IS NEVER AN ERROR
//! ============================================================================
//! Signing in ADDS. Every consumer of DripLine data keeps its direct-provider
//! fallback, so "unavailable" costs a shared cache and nothing else — no trade
//! is blocked, no chart is empty that would otherwise have filled. The UI says
//! what is missing and what to do about it; it does not raise an alarm.
