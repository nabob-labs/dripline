//! The chain-adapter seam: chain-specific behaviour behind one trait.
//!
//! Neutral modules that need a chain fact (native-unit conversion, address
//! validation, explorer URLs, market-data network slugs) call [`adapter()`]
//! instead of naming a `ChainId` variant or a Solana constant directly. With
//! one supported chain this always resolves to the Solana adapter; a second
//! chain adds a match arm here, not a call-site branch.
