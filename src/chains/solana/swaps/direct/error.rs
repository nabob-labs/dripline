//! Typed failures of the direct pool-swap engine.
//!
//! Every consumer decides from the VARIANT, never from the message. The two
//! distinctions that matter most:
//!
//! * [`DirectSwapError::submitted`] — did anything reach the chain? A swap that
//!   failed before submission may be retried; one that timed out waiting for
//!   confirmation must NEVER be retried, because the transaction may still land.
//! * [`DirectSwapError::is_token_fault`] — is the token untradable here, or did
//!   OUR side fail? A router or RPC fault must never count against a mint.
