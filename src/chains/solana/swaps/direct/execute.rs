//! Turning a [`SwapPlan`] into a landed, verified transaction.
//!
//! The step order is the money-safety contract of the engine:
//!
//! 1. preflight the wallet's balance — a swap it cannot afford never reaches RPC
//!    for a build it was always going to lose;
//! 2. build and sign — nothing is on the network yet;
//! 3. simulate — a mis-built instruction is rejected here for free, and the
//!    MEASURED compute cost tightens the limit the transaction actually requests;
//! 4. send — the point of no return;
//! 5. settle — poll for a landed signature, re-broadcasting the same signed
//!    transaction against network drops, until either it lands, it fails on
//!    chain, or its blockhash provably expires unseen;
//! 6. verify — read back what actually arrived.
//!
//! Anything that fails at steps 1-3 returns an error whose
//! [`DirectSwapError::submitted`] is false, and is safe to retry.
//!
//! Step 5 is why this module exists in its current shape. A transaction is
//! provably DEAD once the block height passes the `lastValidBlockHeight` of its
//! blockhash and the signature still has not been seen: the runtime rejects any
//! blockhash older than 151 blocks, so that transaction can never be included
//! after that point, by any node, ever. That is the ONE post-send outcome that is
//! definitively safe to retry — [`DirectSwapError::BlockhashExpired`], whose
//! `submitted()` is `false`. Every other post-send failure keeps `submitted()`
//! `true`, including [`DirectSwapError::ConfirmationTimeout`]: a timeout while the
//! blockhash is STILL valid means the transaction may yet land, and retrying it
//! risks buying the position twice.
