//! Proving what a confirmed swap actually delivered.
//!
//! Two different guarantees, and they must not be confused:
//!
//! * SAFETY comes from `min_out` inside the swap instruction. The pool program
//!   itself refuses to return less, so a transaction that confirmed WITHOUT an
//!   error already proves at least the minimum arrived. Nothing measured here
//!   can make a confirmed swap unsafe after the fact.
//! * ACCOUNTING comes from this module. P&L, fills and position sizing need the
//!   amount that actually landed, not the estimate.
//!
//! The two output shapes are measured differently, and only a TOKEN output was
//! ever exact:
//!
//! * A TOKEN output is exact. The transaction's own pre/post token balances for
//!   the swap's destination account give the delta to the raw unit, and a
//!   GROUNDED delta below the guaranteed minimum is a hard
//!   [`DirectSwapError::OutputNotReceived`]. When nothing in the reply can be
//!   attributed to that account at all -- no metadata, or a node that omits the
//!   optional `owner` field -- there is no measurement to judge, and the
//!   chain-guaranteed floor is reported as an estimate instead. An absent
//!   measurement is never a reading of zero.
//! * A NATIVE SOL output is now ALSO exact, most of the time. The WSOL account is
//!   closed in the same transaction, so its own balance is gone by the time this
//!   reads back -- but the swap's own CPI token transfer INTO that account, before
//!   it closes, is still in `meta.innerInstructions`, and it carries the precise
//!   amount the pool paid out. Falling back to the owner's lamport delta (which
//!   also carries the transaction fee and any rent that moved) only happens when
//!   the inner instructions are missing or unparsable -- never as the first
//!   choice, and never used to FAIL a swap the chain already accepted.
