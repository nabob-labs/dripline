//! The contract every direct-swap venue implements.
//!
//! A venue is one DEX program. It is split deliberately into two halves:
//!
//! * [`PoolVenue`] — the async half. It knows which accounts a pool needs and
//!   reads them from chain. This is the only part that touches RPC.
//! * [`PoolMarket`] — the PURE half. Given decoded bytes it answers what the pool
//!   trades, what a swap would return, and what the swap instruction looks like.
//!   No RPC, no clock, no config. That is what makes the offline test tier able
//!   to assert real numbers against real captured account data.
//!
//! Adding a DEX means implementing this pair in `venues/` and registering it in
//! `super::registry` — nothing else in the engine changes.
