//! One module per DEX program the direct engine can swap in.
//!
//! Each venue owns the exact byte layout of its program's accounts, the exact
//! curve those accounts describe, and the exact instruction that program expects.
//! Nothing here is shared with the PRICE decoders in
//! `crate::chains::solana::pools::decoders`: those answer "what is this token
//! worth", depend on a decimals cache, and may fall back to an approximation. A
//! swap venue may not — it reads decimals out of the pool state itself and fails
//! rather than guess, because its numbers become a `min_out` that real money is
//! settled against.
