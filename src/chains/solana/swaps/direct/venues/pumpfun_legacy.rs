//! Pump.fun legacy (`6EF8rrec…`), the bonding curve every pump.fun token trades
//! on before it graduates to pump-swap (`pumpfun_amm.rs`). The hardest venue in
//! this engine to get right, because the fee mechanism looked instruction-
//! dependent and was NOT — see "The fee" below for what it actually is.
//!
//! # Layout, verified against mainnet
//!
//! `BondingCurve` is 150 (migrated) or 256 (full) bytes, of which the first 115
//! are meaningful and identical in both sizes:
//!
//! ```text
//!  0..8   discriminator (17 b7 f8 37 60 d8 ac 60)
//!  8      virtual_token_reserves u64
//! 16      virtual_sol_reserves u64
//! 24      real_token_reserves u64
//! 32      real_sol_reserves u64
//! 40      token_total_supply u64
//! 48      complete bool
//! 49      creator pubkey
//! 81      is_mayhem_mode bool
//! 82      is_cashback_coin bool
//! 83      quote_mint pubkey   -- the DEFAULT pubkey for a native-SOL curve
//! ```
//!
//! Confirmed against the on-chain IDL (account `AYgC53tU5BbP2NAnv5nConJxAdpQZctvmZK88pu69xRs`)
//! and a real curve's bytes: `creator` at 49 derives the correct `creator_vault`
//! PDA for a live trade (`3yWiFWMJmcrRiaVJatHnz4o3D9qJ83xhkL6uSdcVBBor` from
//! creator `7ufmve7ZSFCzuNcKRunYrGtyb2Ka1MXzkWwf7jZhVsmL`, bump 254).
//!
//! # The pair is TOKEN/NATIVE SOL, never WSOL
//!
//! `quote_mint` at offset 83 is the DEFAULT pubkey on every classic curve this
//! venue supports — pump's newer per-curve alt-quote-mint feature (`buy_v2`,
//! `buy_exact_quote_in_v2`, a totally different, larger account shape with its
//! own `associated_creator_vault` WSOL leg) sets this field to a real mint and
//! is a DIFFERENT product on the same programme; a curve with a non-default
//! `quote_mint` is refused here rather than guessed at.
//!
//! Settlement is NATIVE lamports: a buy debits the signer's own balance and a
//! sell credits it directly, never through a WSOL token account. See
//! [`PoolMarket::settles_native_sol`] and the ordering note in `super::super::plan`
//! for what that changes about the platform fee.
//!
//! # The fee: NOT gated by which instruction runs
//!
//! An earlier attempt at this venue was abandoned because two real transactions
//! showed `creator_fee_basis_points` at 0 on a plain `buy` and 30 on what looked
//! like `buy_exact_quote_in`. Replaying five more real trades (three `buy`,
//! `sell` and `buy_exact_sol_in`; the earlier two turned out to be `Buy` and
//! `BuyExactQuoteInV2` — the SECOND one is not this venue's instruction at all,
//! it is the alt-quote-mint product above) shows the true rule is nothing to do
//! with the instruction:
//!
//! * Both rates come from the SAME `FeeConfig` account
//!   (`8Wf5TiAheLUqBrKXeYg2JtAFFMWtKdG2BSFgqUcPVwTt`, PDA `["fee_config",
//!   PROGRAM_ID]` under the fee programme `pfeeUxB6…`), read directly rather
//!   than CPI'd — every trade this venue replayed returned the identical
//!   `(lp=0, protocol=95, creator=30)` bps regardless of size or instruction,
//!   because this `FeeConfig`'s tier table currently holds exactly ONE tier at
//!   threshold 0 (unlike pump-swap's many-tier table). Market cap is still
//!   computed and the table is still consulted properly, in case that changes.
//! * `protocol_fee_bps` is charged on every trade with no gate, split ~evenly
//!   between two of `Global.fee_recipients`/`buyback_fee_recipients` picked
//!   BY THE CALLER (live swaps used a different pair almost every time) — the
//!   programme does the actual split internally; this venue only has to name
//!   valid recipients, never compute the split.
//! * `creator_fee_bps` is charged ONLY when `BondingCurve.creator` is not the
//!   default pubkey. Verified exactly: a trade on a curve with `creator ==
//!   default` (`buy_exact_sol_in`,
//!   `QDtXrArfEXdJJDfh7iVQfcZynEz9E2xqrkHFQCYWKFr4kUAebUXipXLdC5mLYMahyj2CKwNKBPwiDZN3qJACXbr`)
//!   paid ZERO to `creator_vault`; three trades on curves WITH a creator paid
//!   `creator_vault` exactly `ceil(net_curve_amount * 30 / 10_000)` — to the
//!   lamport, on both a `buy` and two different `sell`s.
//! * `is_mayhem_mode` waives EVERY fee, protocol included: three independent
//!   zero-fee trades all had `is_mayhem_mode = true`; three fee-charging trades
//!   all had it `false`. This venue refuses a mayhem curve rather than guess at
//!   the alternate settlement its logs imply (`buyback_basis_points` reaching
//!   5000 suggests fees are redirected, not skipped, but that path is unbuilt).
//! * `is_cashback_coin` showed one trade with protocol charged normally and
//!   creator NOT charged, but that is a single data point read at CURRENT
//!   curve state rather than replayed at the trade's own slot — NOT verified
//!   to this venue's bar. A cashback curve is refused, exactly like pump-swap
//!   AMM already refuses one.
//!
//! Original transactions that looked instruction-gated, both re-examined:
//! `66zyMCmAsPhRdzzUUpsF8v7ee5hsnjYMhGH4DbKrtiEPqxhWAePjMhTSCzWLBWmoCnmqWuivEkFQXY8QGekRk4Mv`
//! (`Buy` on an `is_cashback_coin` curve — the missing creator fee is the
//! cashback case above, not the instruction) and
//! `2SjdDD9iktpupPZvj4eZepcCR1HgRdDmtZ98W7GCNJqumRcwjsHea2BA4u72vjTL4ozdpkam23a4Ljv5GYkqMVSi`
//! (`BuyExactQuoteInV2`, the alt-quote-mint product, out of scope here).
//!
//! Fee-charging replays that pin the formula exactly: `5tNyk8fRzJYM…` (`buy`,
//! protocol 656,791 = creator×10,000/30 = ceil(69,135,801×95/10,000), creator
//! 207,408 = ceil(69,135,801×30/10,000)), `3UJ5DiLxYAFg…` and `4D6CR9NhoBvn…`
//! (`sell`, same formula off the curve's gross SOL delta), `QDtXrArf…`
//! (`buy_exact_sol_in`, protocol only, creator curve had no creator).
//!
//! # Buy is a SEARCH, and it is exact
//!
//! `buy_exact_sol_in`'s `spendable_sol_in` is spent as `net + fees(net)`, fees
//! rounded up, so this venue searches for the largest `net` satisfying that and
//! then takes ONE RAW UNIT BELOW it — the identical technique and the identical
//! correction `pumpfun_amm.rs::swappable_from_spend` applies to the identical
//! fee mechanism in the same programme family. Without the `-1` the search is
//! one lamport too generous on some curves (not all), which is an unsatisfiable
//! `min_out`; with it, being one unit low costs a couple of raw units of output
//! and nothing else.
//!
//! It reproduces the real trade
//! `QDtXrArfEXdJJDfh7iVQfcZynEz9E2xqrkHFQCYWKFr4kUAebUXipXLdC5mLYMahyj2CKwNKBPwiDZN3qJACXbr`
//! (vault delta `591_381_872` for `spendable_sol_in = 597_000_000`), and both
//! `a_pump_legacy_quote_is_exact_to_the_raw_unit` and its `_with_no_creator`
//! twin pass — the zero-slippage proof, on a curve with the creator fee inside
//! the number and on one without it.
//!
//! # The undocumented trailing accounts
//!
//! Every trade instruction (`buy`, `sell`, `buy_exact_sol_in`) reads two more
//! accounts than its own published IDL entry lists, positioned right after
//! `fee_program` — the deployed programme is ahead of its IDL here exactly the
//! way pump-swap AMM's is. Both are named in the binary's own symbol strings
//! (`strings` on the `ProgramData` account, skipping its 45-byte header):
//! `buyback_fee_recipient` and `associated_quote_buyback_fee_recipient`. Live
//! trades pick two DIFFERENT entries out of `Global.buyback_fee_recipients`
//! (eight slots) freely — every one of five replayed trades used a different
//! pair, and only the SECOND of the two ever received lamports (the first
//! showed a zero balance delta in every replay). This venue passes the first
//! two distinct non-default slots; which slot the programme actually pays is
//! its own business, not something the caller's `min_out` depends on.
//!
//! A THIRD account, `bonding_curve_v2` (`["bonding-curve-v2", mint]`, again
//! hyphenated per the same binary strings), is required immediately before
//! that pair, but ONLY when the curve has a creator (`InvalidBondingCurveV2`,
//! `0x17ba`, "bonding_curve_v2 remaining account is missing or invalid" —
//! found live, after the buyback pair alone still failed on a creator-set
//! curve). It need not exist; only its address is checked, exactly like
//! pump-swap AMM's `pool_v2`. Passing it for a curve with no creator would
//! shift the buyback pair by one, the same off-by-one pump-swap AMM's own
//! `pool_v2` causes.
//!
//! # Reserves are VIRTUAL, same trap as pump-swap
//!
//! `virtual_token_reserves`/`virtual_sol_reserves` are what the constant-product
//! curve is priced against, not `real_token_reserves`/`real_sol_reserves` — the
//! same trap `pumpfun_amm.rs` documents for the post-graduation pool. A sell's
//! payout is additionally capped at `real_sol_reserves`, the vault's own
//! balance, the way pump-swap AMM caps a boosted pool's payout at its real
//! vault.
