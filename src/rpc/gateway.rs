//! Free transaction relaying for signed-in accounts.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! WHY THIS IS NOT A PROVIDER IN THE POOL
//! ============================================================================
//! The obvious design is another `ProviderConfig` in the provider list. It is
//! the wrong one, and the reason is worth stating because it will look like an
//! omission later.
//!
//! Providers are chosen by `selector.rs`, which selects on health, latency and
//! priority — never on METHOD. A gateway in that list could be handed
//! `getMultipleAccounts` for pool polling, which runs roughly every 500 ms and
//! is almost the entire RPC cost of an installation. Teaching the selector about
//! methods to prevent that would put a capacity rule in a component whose job is
//! availability, and one refactor later the rule would be gone.
//!
//! So the gateway is an explicit FIRST ATTEMPT for a fixed list of submission
//! methods, checked here and nowhere else. Anything not on that list cannot
//! reach it, because no code path exists that would take it there.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! IT NEVER BLOCKS A TRADE
//! ============================================================================
//! Every failure returns `None`, and the caller carries on down the normal
//! provider path with the user's own RPC. A free service must not be able to
//! stop somebody trading — not when it is down, not when the quota is spent, not
//! when the session has expired.
