//! Materialise reduced wallet-history rounds as `positions` rows.
//!
//! [`reduce_rounds`](super::reduce_rounds) answers "what rounds does this wallet's
//! history contain"; this module answers "which position rows must exist so the
//! dashboard shows them". It deliberately splits into a PURE planner
//! ([`plan_position_writes`]) and a thin impure applier ([`sync_wallet_history`]), so
//! every rule about what a wallet-derived row may claim is testable without a database,
//! a wallet or a clock.
//!
//! # One row per round
//!
//! A round is a fact about the wallet, not about who executed it, so exactly ONE
//! `positions` row may represent it — otherwise a bot-executed buy shows up twice, once
//! as the trader's row and once as an imported round, and every portfolio total counts
//! it twice. A round therefore claims an existing row before it ever inserts one:
//!
//! 1. by `round_key`, the identity stamped on the row by an earlier sync;
//! 2. otherwise by the `entry_transaction_signature` of a row that has no round key yet
//!    and holds the same mint — the trader's own row for the very swap this round was
//!    reduced from. Claiming it is called ADOPTION, and it happens at most once per row.
//!
//! # Ownership boundary
//!
//! What the ledger may write depends on who owns the row.
//!
//! An [`PositionOrigin::External`] row is the ledger's own: it owns the *history* fields
//! (amounts, basis, realized P&L, signatures, open/closed) and nothing else. Live-price
//! fields (`current_price`, `price_highest`, `price_lowest`, unrealized P&L) belong to
//! the price updater, and `archived` belongs to the user — a resync must never move a
//! row the user archived back into the open list, and must never archive one on its own.
//!
//! A row the bot executed (Auto/Manual/Copy) keeps its origin, management and strategy
//! targets forever, and keeps the fee-exact SOL it booked for the legs IT executed. The
//! ledger RECONCILES it against the chain: it stamps the round key, flags a frozen
//! account, follows the holding up as well as down, and closes a position whose token
//! was sold somewhere else. Following it UP is what makes a buy the user made in another
//! wallet app show up — it is the same round, so it is the same row, and the row's basis
//! becomes the trader's booked SOL plus the chain's SOL for every leg the trader did not
//! book (see [`TraderLegs`]). Nothing else the trader owns is rewritten, and a row with
//! work in flight (an unverified entry, a pending DCA or partial exit) is left
//! completely alone until that work lands — including not being duplicated.
//!
//! Freezing is a FLAG, never an action: a frozen token account sets
//! `holding_state = "frozen"` so the user can see the holding cannot be sold and archive
//! it if they choose. Nothing here archives, hides or closes a frozen position.
