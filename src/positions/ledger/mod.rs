//! Wallet-history ledger — deterministic position rounds from observed balance deltas.
//!
//! The truth this module reduces over is the LOCAL, fully-processed transaction store:
//! `subject_asset_deltas` rows produced by [`crate::transactions::deltas`]. It makes no
//! network call, reads no price feed and asks no provider what a position "should" be.
//! Given the same rows it always produces the same rounds.
//!
//! # What a round is
//!
//! One round is one `0 -> ... -> 0` lifecycle of a single mint in one wallet. The first
//! acquisition that lifts the balance off zero OPENS it; the disposal that returns the
//! balance to zero CLOSES it. Buying the same mint again later is a NEW round, never a
//! reopen of the old one. Within a round, a second buy is an add (DCA) and a sell that
//! leaves a remainder is a partial exit — every entry and every exit is kept as its own
//! [`LedgerEvent`] so the dashboard can show them individually rather than as one
//! averaged blob.
//!
//! A token -> token swap needs no special case: the sold mint's balance hits zero (its
//! round closes) and the bought mint's balance leaves zero (a round opens) inside the
//! same signature.
//!
//! # Honesty over completeness
//!
//! SOL is the monetary unit, so a cost basis is only ever taken from a SOL or wSOL leg.
//! An airdrop, a USD-quoted fill, a mixed-quote round, a token -> token swap with no
//! SOL leg, or history that does not reconcile against the observed balance all clear
//! [`LedgerRound::basis_complete`] / [`LedgerRound::history_complete`] instead of being
//! assigned an invented number. USD is never back-converted to SOL at today's rate: a
//! round bought with USDC has a real basis we simply cannot express in SOL, and
//! guessing it would produce a plausible, permanently wrong P&L.
//!
//! A round with `basis_complete == false` must never be rendered with a P&L.
