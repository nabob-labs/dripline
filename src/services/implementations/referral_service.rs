//! Referral activation — the ONLY code in DripLine that reports anything.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//! READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE.
//! ============================================================================
//! DripLine has no telemetry. This service is the single exception, it is
//! OPT-IN, and it stays silent until the user types a referral code into
//! Settings. With `referral.code` empty, `is_enabled()` returns false, the
//! service never starts, and no request is ever constructed.
//!
//! When it does run it sends ONE JSON body:
//!
//!     { referral_code, proofs: [{ wallet, issued_at, signature }], platform, version }
//!
//! and nothing else. Not balances, not positions, not trades, not P&L, not the
//! config, not an IP we choose to include, not a machine id.
//!
//! Each wallet signs a short, domain-separated statement binding its PUBLIC
//! address to the referral code and current time. Private keys stay local and
//! no transaction is created. The proof is required because a public address
//! alone says nothing about who chose the referral code.
//!
//! This repository is public, which is what makes the paragraph above worth
//! writing: it is checkable rather than promised.
